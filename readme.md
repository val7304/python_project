# Python_project

Basic Website built in Python and Flask

Basic website for project 3/3 in devOps.

 - update : as we go along

this site was created to create a 3-tier architecture on a redHat server (vagrant) and tested with devOps tools (pipeline, monitoring)

Played on a local server with Flask:   `$ run flask` command and open browser on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
